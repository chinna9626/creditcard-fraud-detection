## Design Thinking Process
Our fraud detection system is developed following the Design Thinking framework, which includes the following stages:
1. **Empathize**: Understand the problem from stakeholders' perspective.
2. **Define**: Clearly define the problem and success criteria.
3. **Ideate**: Brainstorm data sources, features, and machine learning algorithms.
4. **Prototype**: Acquire, preprocess data, and create additional features.
5. **Test**: Split data, train models, and evaluate performance.
6. **Feedback**: Gather feedback and iterate on the model.
7. **Implement**: Deploy the model into a production environment.
8. **Learn**: Monitor the model's performance and adapt as needed.
9. **Share**: Communicate success and impact.
10. **Scale**: Consider scalability as the business grows.
11. **Reflect**: Reflect on the design thinking process.

## Data Source
- Utilized a dataset containing transaction data, including transaction amount, timestamp, merchant information, and card details.

## Data Preprocessing
- Cleaned and preprocessed the data, handling missing values.
- Normalized features to ensure consistency in scale.

## Feature Engineering
- Created additional features to enhance fraud detection, including transaction frequency and amount deviations.

## Model Selection
- Chose suitable machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, for fraud detection.

## Model Training
- Trained the selected model using the preprocessed data.

## Evaluation
- Evaluated the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

## Usage
Provide instructions on how to use the code and the fraud detection system. Include details on setting up the environment, running the code, and making predictions using the trained model.
